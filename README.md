# City Explorer - Code 301 Project

**Author** Andrew Smith
**Version** 1.0.0

## Overview

This application allows a user to type a desired City name in a search bar. When the user hits the search button, information (such as weather, lat-lon location) about that city will be displayed to the user. This information is accessed by a server that reaches different APIs and extracts the correct data.
